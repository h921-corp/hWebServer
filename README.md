# hWebServer
A USBWebserver alternative with a CLI instead of a GUI (because im lazy). All binaries (PHP, Apache & MySQL) can be drop in replaced.
The reason I made this is because i like using UsbWebserver, but the outdated binaries were slightly annoying, due to missing functions.

Unlike USBWebServer, all configs are NOT in one directory. The configs for each binary are in their respective folders. (example: Apache config = .\Apache24\conf\httpd.conf)
